# Systemd override file for Maru.
#
# Having udev coldplug all devices as usual can cause failures to control them
# correctly from Android, e.g. Bluetooth may fail to toggle on certain
# hardware. To prevent this, override the default coldplug behavior to only
# coldplug devices within the input subsystem.
#
# Note that completely masking the coldplug service--or even dropping udev
# itself--is not an option because we still need the coldplug for input
# devices. This ensures that the desktop automatically picks up input devices
# that were paired prior to desktop boot.
